### Purpose
Express is an amazing framework. There are an infinite ways in which an Express app can be organized and maintained, which is great. This is where API Works comes into play.
API Works allows us to create Express apps using folder structures. It helps us organize our data models, and separate them from our data peristence layer, baking best practices into even the smallest of Express applications.
It's our opinion that it's significantly easier to scan a directory, understand what pieces are into an app, and to then improve isolated parts of your application. This makes working in teams significantly better, and increases code maintainability.

### Disclaimer
Hey now, this is still in beta mode. The longer it works for us, the sooner it'll mature out of beta.

Happy coding!
